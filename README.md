# TokenField

Use a token field when you want typed text to be transformed into "tokens", which are visually distinct elements in the text field interface. For example, you might use a token field in a mail app to display email addresses for individual users. The distinct appearance of tokens makes them easy for users to distinguish from surrounding text.
